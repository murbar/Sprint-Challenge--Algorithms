# A

O(n)

This one is a bit tricky. I added a counter to the code and graphed it to be sure. This first line is O(1) and the loop looks like 0(n^3) at first blush but in the body of the loop we are incrementing a by n^2 so the while loop actually runs 0(n^3) / O(n^2) with is O(n).

```
b)  sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
      i += 1
      for j in range(i + 1, n):
        j += 1
        for k in range(j + 1, n):
          k += 1
          for l in range(k + 1, 10 + k):
            l += 1
            sum += 1
```

```
c)  def bunnyEars(bunnies):
      if bunnies == 0:
        return 0

      return 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1)
```

## Exercise II

Suppose that you have an _n_-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off floor _f_ or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor _f_. Devise a strategy to determine the value of _f_ such that the number of dropped eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode and give the runtime complexity of your solution.
